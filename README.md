A simple next.js application utilizing WP as a content management system with an admin log-in/log-out functionality. 

## Description

For this assigment I built a simple application in next.js, that uses a headless WP installation for content and authentication. 
This assignment required me to 

- Return an array of items with 2 properties
- Link to a detail page for each item and display 3 properties
- Create a contact form with validation
- Create an Admin log-in form that makes a log-in request to Wordpress API with a JWT plugin installed.
- Upon successfully logging-in, user is redirected to a user admin route. 
- If log-in is unsuccessful, a message is displayed.
